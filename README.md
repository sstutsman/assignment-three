Assignment Three
=================

This assignment is very open ended. As such, instructions will be simple. Read through the entire instructions before you begin.

1. Fork this project.
2. Clone your fork.
3. Create a folder named the same as your Github username in the repo root. Do all of the work from the folder you created.
4. In Android Studio, create a project.
5. Within this project, you will implement a RecyclerView. This RecyclerView will display a list of albums. You will have to create an
Album class to mock this data. At minimum, this album list must contain album cover art, name, artist, track count, year, and publisher.
This list must contain a minimum of 10 items.
6. Style matters. If you dump all of the information in the item's top left, I will be angry. Be creative.
7. When I click on an item, I want to be taken to a new activity which displays the same (or maybe more!) information about the album.
8. When you're satisfied with your work, submit a pull request back to me.

You will have to find images and information online and put them in to your res/drawable folder.

You will have to do some research to learn how to do some of these things. Remember to search as specifically as you can.

Use Git well. If you only have one commit message and it says "completed the app," I will be angry.

That's it! Don't forget to look back at old lessons. Aim to do this work on your own; a neighbor's education is not your own.
